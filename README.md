# Place food order requests directly from your kitchen!

If you manage your food plan using a Discord channel, then this app is for you. 

Before you start, you will need to enter 2 things:
- Your Discord channel webhook URL (for the food channel)
- An Airtable API key (to connect to a table storing food items)
